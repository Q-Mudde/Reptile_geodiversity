Proposal: Proposal has been written an rewritten many times now. The final version has been sent to everyone if everything
went correctly. 

Data handling: The reptile range maps can now be transferred to gridcells on a global scale. (110 x 110). I also created
a data.frame with all gridcells and reptile species to be albe to perform analyses on. 
Now the Geodiversity per gridcell has to be added, for this I need to wait before this data is placed on the server. 

Results/figures: Some examples of reptiel rangemaps > gridcells are posted in the repository. The coloring or value scaling
of these figures still have to be adjusted but the core code is done and personally I think the figures look fine. I also 
compared them with figures from Roll et al. and they look the same (except my figures are based on gridcells now ofcourse). 

(29-5) I have been trying several ways of aggregating the high res rasterdata into my 110 even area polygons. Peronally I think
that transforming the rasterdata into points and then assigning points to the polygons they fall in, is the best way to do this
in R. However, for now this seems to take a lot of computation time, I think because spatial points data is a lot less efficient
in containing high res data than .tiff files.
